# Minum - Smart Water Reminder App

Stay hydrated and on track with Minum, your smart water reminder app! Sync with your Google Account, Google Fit, and Health Connect to automatically calculate your ideal intake using weather, calories burned, and weight data. Manually or automatically set targets, log and manage your water intake, track daily progress, and view long-term hydration trends and calendar.

## Prerequisites

-   Flutter SDK (version 3.0.0 or higher)
-   Dart SDK (version 3.0.0 or higher)
-   An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins.
-   Firebase account for Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
-   (Optional) Access to Google Fit and Health Connect APIs if you plan to implement full integration.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd minum
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication and potentially for data storage.

**IMPORTANT:** You need to configure Firebase for your project.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Register your app:**
    * Add an Android app to your Firebase project:
        * Package name: `com.halixm.minum`
        * Follow the instructions to download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/`.
    * Add an iOS app to your Firebase project:
        * Bundle ID: `com.halixm.minum`
        * Follow the instructions to download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `ios/Runner/`.
3.  **Enable Authentication Methods:** In the Firebase console, go to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" and enable "Email/Password" and "Google".
    * **For Google Sign-In on Android:** You'll need to add your SHA-1 fingerprint to the Firebase project settings. You can get it by running `cd android && ./gradlew signingReport`.
4.  **Initialize Firebase in Flutter:**
    * Install the Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools` (or other methods from Firebase docs).
    * Login to Firebase: `firebase login`.
    * Install FlutterFire CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`.
    * Configure your project: `flutterfire configure`. This will autogenerate the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file. Make sure to select the Firebase project you created.

    *If `flutterfire configure` gives issues, you might need to manually create `lib/firebase_options.dart` based on the Firebase project settings (less recommended).*

### 4. (Conceptual) Google Fit & Health Connect Setup

Actual integration with Google Fit and Health Connect requires:
1.  Setting up projects in Google Cloud Console.
2.  Requesting necessary OAuth scopes.
3.  Handling API calls, likely through platform channels or dedicated plugins that manage native SDKs.
4.  Complying with Google's data privacy and API usage policies.

For this boilerplate, these services are mocked. To implement them fully, you would need to:
-   Find or create Flutter plugins that interface with the native Google Fit and Health Connect SDKs.
-   Add necessary permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android) and `Info.plist` (iOS).
-   Implement OAuth 2.0 flows for authorization.

### 5. (Optional) API Keys for Weather

If you integrate a weather API:
1.  Sign up for a weather API service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2.  Obtain an API key.
3.  Store this key securely, preferably using environment variables or a configuration file not committed to version control. For this project, you might place it in a constants file initially, but for production, use a more secure method.
    * Example: `lib/src/core/constants/api_keys.dart` (ensure this file is in `.gitignore` if it contains sensitive keys).

### 6. Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

To run on a specific device:

```bash
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

## Building for Release

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
```
Ensure you have set up signing configurations for Android in `android/app/build.gradle`.

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```
Ensure you have set up your Apple Developer account and signing certificates in Xcode.

## Testing Strategy

-   **Unit Tests:** Located in `test/unit/`. These test individual functions, methods, or classes.
    ```bash
    flutter test test/unit
    ```
-   **Widget Tests:** Located in `test/widget/`. These test individual Flutter widgets in isolation.
    ```bash
    flutter test test/widget
    ```
-   **Integration Tests (End-to-End):** Located in `test/integration_test/`. These test complete app flows or features. Uses the `integration_test` package.
    ```bash
    flutter test integration_test
    ```
    For running on a device/emulator:
    ```bash
    flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
    ```
    (Note: setup for `flutter drive` might vary, `integration_test` is often run directly with `flutter test integration_test` now).

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

A basic CI/CD workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. This workflow will:
1.  Set up Flutter.
2.  Install dependencies.
3.  Run linters and format checks.
4.  Run tests.
5.  (Optionally extendable) Build the app.

This workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
